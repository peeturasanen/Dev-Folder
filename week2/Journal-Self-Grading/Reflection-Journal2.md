We had some difficulties picking a topic for our project.

## What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
I succesfully completed all the activities during class and learned how to do them now.

I learned how to use postman and all the other softwares.

## Online Resources:
The homework videos were useful.

## Coping Strategies:
- Academic Progress:

I got all the activities done and those really together with the videos helped me learn basic js.

- Soft Skills Development:

I communicated well in our group and we got all the activities done.  

## Project Management:
I dont really know how to answer to this. But we did great in our group.

## Final Thoughts:
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.
